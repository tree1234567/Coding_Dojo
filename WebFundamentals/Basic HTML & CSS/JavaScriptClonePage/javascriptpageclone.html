            <h4>JavaScript Basics</h4>
            
            <p> JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extrememly popular for a variety of reasons. It is small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment(a web browswer or Node server), it can be connected to the onjects of these environments to provide programmatic control of them.

                    <li class="listmarg"><a href="http/google.com">Variable Declarations</a>Javascript variables are containers for storing data values- imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. THese unique names are called identifiers. <span class = "keyword"> var x;</span></li>

                    <li class="listmarg"><a href="http/google.com">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScropt variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.<span class = "keyword"> var x = 10;</span> </li>



                    <li class="listmarg"><a href="http/google.com">Data Types</a>Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you ned to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScropt primitives: Booleans - <span class="keyword">true</span> or <span class="keyword">false;</span> null <span class="keyword">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="keyword">42</span> or <span class="keyword">3.14159;</span> String- <span class="keyword">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span class="keyword">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span class="keyword">{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</span></li>





                    <li class="listmarg"><a href="http/google.com">Conditionals</a>When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statments in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span class="keyword">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block;<span class="keyword">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="keyword">else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>

                    <li class="listmarg"><a href="http/google.com">Loops</a> There are many differenet kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
                    <li class="listmarg"><a href="http/google.com">Function</a> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. THink of if as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started,first we scew the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! we finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our functions over and over again.</li>
